# GitHub Application

<Callout type="warning">
  GraphQL Inspector App was deprecated and is no longer available. You can still use the
  [CLI](/docs/installation#cli) and the [GitHub Action](/docs/installation#github-action) to
  automate your workflow.

[GraphQL Inspector App](https://github.com/apps/graphql-inspector) is a GitHub Application that you
can install in any of your repositories.

GraphQL Inspector App checks your Pull Request to find breaking changes (and others) in a GraphQL
Schema, against your `master` branch.

We strongly believe in Open Source and that's why we made it possible to have a per-repository,
self-hosted GraphQL Inspector App thanks to GitHub Actions or to host your own instance in the
Cloud.

## Main Features

- [Detect changes](#detection-of-changes)
- [Schema change notifications](#schema-change-notifications)
- [In-Code annotations](#annotations)
- [Intercept checks with serverless functions](../recipes/intercept)
- [Use many environments](../recipes/environments)
- [Use live and running GraphQL endpoints](../recipes/endpoints)

## Usage

Configure GraphQL Inspector in `.github/graphql-inspector.yaml`:

```yaml
branch: master
schema: schema.graphql # an output of `$ graphql-inspector introspect ...`
```

It's also possible to setup everything in `package.json` (it must be placed in the root directory).

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "graphql-inspector": {
    "branch": "master",
    "schema": "schema.graphql"
  }
}
```

For example, `schema.graphql` points to a file in the root directory of a repository.

## Features

### Schema Change Notifications

To stay up to date with changes in your GraphQL Schema and to receive notifications on Slack,
Discord or even via WebHooks, read the ["Notifications"](/docs/notifications) chapter.

### Annotations

In some cases, you want to get a summary of changes but no annotations on a schema file. Annotations
are enabled by default but to disable them, please follow the instructions in
["Annotations"](../recipes/annotations) chapter.

### Detection of changes

By default, GraphQL Inspector fails the Pull Request when it detects some breaking changes.

To force a successful check just set `failOnBreaking` to `false` or apply the
[`approved-breaking-change`](#approved-breaking-change-label) label.

### Using GraphQL Endpoint

Read more about [using live and running GraphQL endpoint](../recipes/endpoints) as a source of
schema.

### Using Multiple environments

Read more about [managing many environments](../recipes/environments).

### Intercept Checks With Serverless Functions

Learn how to
[remotely control detected changes and accept/reject Pull Requests](../recipes/intercept).

## Other

### Approved Breaking Change Label

Label to mark Pull Request introducing breaking changes as safe and expected

(`approved-breaking-change` by default)

You can customize the label's name in `diff.approveLabel` option (see
[Full configuration](#full-configuration) below).

### Limit Summary Length

The length of a summary of a CI check is limited by GitHub API. This is why we decided to show only
a list of 100 changes.

(`100` by default)

You can adjust the limit as you wish using `diff.summaryLimit` option (see
[Full configuration](#full-configuration) below).

### Experimental

**`experimental_merge`**

(`true` by default)

Merge Pull Request's branch with the target branch to get the schema. Helps to get the correct state
of schema when Pull Request is behind the target branch.

### Full Configuration

```yaml
# Enabling / Disabling Schema Diff
diff: true # enabled by default

# Customizing Schema Diff
diff:
  # Pull Request annotations (enabled by default)
  annotations: true
  # Fail on breaking changes or force SUCCESS when disabled (enabled by default)
  failOnBreaking: true
  # Intercept list of detected changes and decide whether to accept a Pull Request
  intercept: '<url>'
  # Merge Pull Request's branch with the target branch to get the schema (enabled by default)
  experimental_merge: true
  # Label to mark Pull Request introducing breaking changes as safe and expected ('approved-breaking-change' by default)
  approveLabel: approved-breaking-change
  # Limit a list of changes in summary to max 150
  summaryLimit: 150

# Notifications (disabled by default)
notifications:
  slack: 'webhook url'
  discord: 'webhook url'
  webhook: 'webhook url'

# Your main / target branch
branch: master

# A path to a schema file
schema: schema.graphql

# Use live and running endpoint as a source of schema
endpoint: '<url>'
```

### Recommended workflow

We recommend to automate the generation of `schema.graphql` and use `husky` to run
[`$ graphql-inspector introspect`](../essentials/introspect):

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "graphql:save": "graphql-inspector introspect schema.js --write schema.graphql"
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "pnpm graphql:save && git add schema.graphql"
    }
  }
}
```

This way your schema file is always up to date with your actual schema.

Now on every commit or every Pull Request, the GraphQL Inspector App will annotate every change,
next to the line in the code where it happened.

### Deploy your own GraphQL Inspector App

We strongly believe in Open Source and that's why we made it possible to host your instances of the
GraphQL Inspector App.

<Callout>
  Under the hood, the GraphQL Inspector uses [Probot](https://probot.github.io), a bot made by the
  GitHub team.

There's a well-written ["Deployment" chapter](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment) on Probot's
documentation.
